# Notes on Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Log

## Day 1 : Jan 2, 2019

**Today's Progress** : n-gram model, Bag-of-Word(BoW), Tf-Idf

## Day 2 : Jan 3, 2019

**Today's Progress** :
- Word Embedding https://github.com/nahidalam/NLPNotes/blob/master/2_WordEmbedding.md
- Parse Tree https://github.com/nahidalam/NLPNotes/blob/master/2_ParseTree.md

## Day 3: Jan 4, 2019

**Today's Progress** : POS Tagging, Build your own POS tagger

## Day 4: Jan 5, 2019
**Today's Progress** :
- Build your own POS tagger (continued) https://github.com/nahidalam/NLP_Study_Group/tree/master/7_Weeks_NLP_Projects/Week4_POSTagger

## Day 5: Jan 6, 2019
**Today's Progress** : Worked on a cuisine prediction service. Built the model and wrote a web service to display results based on the predictive model https://github.com/nahidalam/cuisine_prediction_service

## Day 6: Jan 7, 2019
**Today's Progress** :

- Revisited RNN, LSTM (and variants like Peephole Connection), GRU
- LSTM vs. GRU
- Beam Search https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLWuzLLSIgw
- BLEU Score (essentially a MT metrics - how good a generated sentence is)
- Attention paper explanation https://mlexplained.com/2017/12/29/attention-is-all-you-need-explained/

## Day 7: Jan 8, 2019
**Today's Progress** :
- Overview on BERT. Lot to digest but at least got an idea about the transfer learning literature in NLP https://mlexplained.com/2019/01/07/paper-dissected-bert-pre-training-of-deep-bidirectional-transformers-for-language-understanding-explained/

## Day 8: Jan 9, 2019
**Today's Progress** :
- Naive Bayes and its usage in Sentiment analysis. Why Naive Bayes helps in reducing runtime complexity (because of its assumption that features are independent from each other) https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/simplifying-sentiment-analysis-python
- Sentiment analysis using Word Embedding (word2vec), LSTM, Keras  https://ahmedbesbes.com/sentiment-analysis-on-twitter-using-word2vec-and-keras.html
https://www.liip.ch/en/blog/sentiment-detection-with-keras-word-embeddings-and-lstm-deep-learning-networks
- **TODO** Sentiment analysis using BERT embedding https://github.com/brightmart/sentiment_analysis_fine_grain
