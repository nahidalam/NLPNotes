# Notes on Natural Language Processing

This repository is a collection of concepts and code samples on Natural Language
Processing (NLP).

The goal is to

- Increase understanding in NLP
- Understand and practice Deep Learning techniques in NLP 

### But How?

- Discuss NLP concepts in the increasing order of complexity
- Write code samples when needed
- Sometimes I might derail to generic Machine Learning concepts if they come in
the context of an NLP topic
- Understand the why, learn to compare and pro-con of different NLP models


## And Why?

This project was inspired by Siraj Raval's 100DaysofMLCode. But I made it specific
to NLP because of my experience/interest in this space. Also, I don't think it
should end on 100th day. Although the updates to this repo will most likely be
less frequent after 100 days.

## Who am I?
I have a background in Computer Science and work on Conversational AI in my day
job. Previously founded startups to understand human language.
